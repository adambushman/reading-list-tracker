# Reading List Tracker

An interactive list of the books I'm reading and the takeaways I'm working to implement in my life. [Find out what I'm reading](https://adambushman.github.io/reading-list-tracker/)!

## Description

I've recently taken up reading with more commitment than in years past. In part I've been motivated by regular reading materials supplied at work and an ever mounting list of books I'd like read.

In an effort to hold myself accountable, I've created a basic, interactive reading list where I can document the books I'm reading and what I've learned therefrom.
